# QualifiedEngulfing Forex Software

## Description

QualifiedEngulfing is a Forex software developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This software is designed to analyze the Forex market and identify potential trading opportunities based on specific market conditions. It utilizes a unique algorithm to identify patterns and make trading decisions.

The software is programmed in MQL5, a programming language specifically designed for trading robots and technical indicators in the MetaTrader 5 platform. It includes necessary libraries and dependencies for trading, such as Trade and SymbolInfo.

The trading parameters are defined as constants, including the lot size for each trade, stop loss in pips, take profit in pips, and maximum number of trades allowed. These parameters can be customized by the user through a user interface function.

The main functionality of the software is implemented in the following functions:

1. `openBuyTrade` - This function opens a buy trade based on the current price and predefined parameters. It calculates the stop loss and take profit levels and executes the trade using the Trade.Buy function.

2. `openSellTrade` - This function opens a sell trade based on the current price and predefined parameters. It calculates the stop loss and take profit levels and executes the trade using the Trade.Sell function.

3. `analyzeMarket` - This function performs market analysis using the unique algorithm implemented by the user. It identifies potential trade opportunities based on specific market conditions. In this code sample, a bullish engulfing pattern is used as an example to demonstrate the functionality. If the current price is higher than the previous price, a buy trade is opened. If the current price is lower than the previous price, a sell trade is opened.

4. `customizeParameters` - This function provides a user interface for traders to adjust the trading parameters. It allows customization of parameters to identify potential trading opportunities based on individual preferences.

The software also includes other functions for initialization, cleanup, error handling, code optimization, testing, and documentation.
